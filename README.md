# RF-Map-Max
Some typical electromagnetic radiation (EMR) measurements around Auckland. The measurements were taken with an emf-390 meter. The power density units are milliwatts per square meter (mW/m2). The GPS coordinates were logged using an Android phone. The GPS and EMR were combined by the timestamp to give a geospatial representation. The data set was clustered to reduce the number of points displayed on the map.

Each dot on the map can represent multiple measurements. Hovering over a data point will give the statistics for that data point cluster (maximum, average, minimum, radiation source, and the number of data points used for the sample). The legend allows users to filter the data set to include measurements in a range by selecting the checkboxes. The legend and data points are color-coded by the maximum reading for each cluster.
